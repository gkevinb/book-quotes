        It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and

        Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s
        frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,

        Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the
        bottleneck of the brain. 8 It can only pay attention to one problem at a
        time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your
        conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever
        possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious
        mind to do automatically. 9 This is precisely what happens when a habit
        is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so
        you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

        Happiness is simply the absence of desire. When you observe a cue, but
        do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current

        joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you
        have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when
        you no longer want to change your state.
