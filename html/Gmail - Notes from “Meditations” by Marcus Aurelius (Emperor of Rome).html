                                            putting this off, how many
                                            extensions the gods gave you, and
                                            you didn’t use them. At some point
                                            you have to recognize what world it
                                            is that you belong to; what power
                                            rules it and from what source you
                                            spring; that there is a limit to the
                                            time assigned you, and if you don’t
                                            use it to free yourself it will be
                                            gone and will never return.

                                            Roman—like a man—on doing what’s in
                                            front of you with precise and
                                            genuine seriousness, tenderly,
                                            willingly, with justice. And on
                                            freeing yourself from all other
                                            distractions. Yes, you can—if you do
                                            everything as if it were the last
                                            thing you were doing in your life,
                                            and stop being aimless, stop letting
                                            your emotions override what your
                                            mind tells you, stop being
                                            hypocritical, self-centered,
                                            irritable. You see how few things
                                            you have to do to live a satisfying
                                            and reverent life? If you can manage
                                            this, that’s all even the gods can
                                            ask of you.

                                            You need to avoid certain things in

                                            random, everything irrelevant. And
                                            certainly everything self-important
                                            or malicious.

                                            You need to get used to winnowing
                                            your thoughts, so that if someone
                                            says, “What are you thinking about?”
                                            you can respond at once (and
                                            truthfully) that you are thinking
                                            this or thinking that. And it would
                                            be obvious at once from your answer
                                            that your thoughts were
                                            straightforward and considerate
                                            ones—the thoughts of an unselfish
                                            person, one unconcerned with
                                            pleasure and with sensual indulgence
                                            generally, with squabbling, with
                                            slander and envy, or anything else
                                            you’d be ashamed to be caught
                                            thinking.

                                            nature, and that of all rational
                                            beings. It’s what makes
                                            thoughtfulness possible, and
                                            affection for other people, and
                                            submission to the divine.

                                            can ruin your life only if it ruins
                                            your character. Otherwise it cannot
                                            harm you—inside or out.

                                            to say. Get what you can from the
                                            present—thoughtfully, justly.
                                            Unrestrained moderation.

                                            bothering you? But look at how soon
                                            we’re all forgotten. The abyss of
                                            endless time that swallows it all.
                                            The emptiness of all those
                                            applauding hands. The people who
                                            praise us—how capricious they are,
                                            how arbitrary. And the tiny region
                                            in which it all takes place. The
                                            whole earth a point in space—and
                                            most of it uninhabited.

                                            Beautiful things of any kind are
                                            beautiful in themselves and
                                            sufficient to themselves. Praise is
                                            extraneous. The object of praise
                                            remains what it was—no better and no
                                            worse. This applies, I think, even
                                            to “beautiful” things in ordinary
                                            life—physical objects, artworks.

                                            How does the earth find room for all
                                            the bodies buried in it since the
                                            beginning of time? They linger for
                                            whatever length of time, and then,
                                            through change and decomposition,
                                            make room for others. So too with
                                            the souls that inhabit the air. They
                                            linger a little, and then are
                                            changed—diffused and kindled into
                                            fire, absorbed into the logos from
                                            which all things spring, and so make
                                            room for new arrivals.

                                            Because most of what we say and do
                                            is not essential. If you can
                                            eliminate it, you’ll have more time,
                                            and more tranquillity. Ask yourself
                                            at every moment, “Is this
                                            necessary?”

                                            But we need to eliminate unnecessary
                                            assumptions as well. To eliminate
                                            the unnecessary actions that follow.

                                            Those who worked in vain, who failed
                                            to do what they should have—what
                                            they should have remained fixed on
                                            and found satisfaction in.

                                            A key point to bear in mind: The
                                            value of attentiveness varies in
                                            proportion to its object. You’re
                                            better off not giving the small
                                            things more time than they deserve.

                                            you were going to die tomorrow “or
                                            the day after.” Unless you were a
                                            complete coward you wouldn’t kick up
                                            a fuss about which day it was—what
                                            difference could it make? Now
                                            recognize that the difference
                                            between years from now and tomorrow
                                            is just as small.

                                            engraving, the dancer for the dance,
                                            the miser for money or the social
                                            climber for status? When they’re
                                            really possessed by what they do,
                                            they’d rather stop eating and
                                            sleeping than give up practicing
                                            their arts.

                                            Some people, when they do someone a
                                            favor, are always looking for a
                                            chance to call it in. And some
                                            aren’t, but they’re still aware of
                                            it—still regard it as a debt. But
                                            others don’t even do that. They’re
                                            like a vine that produces grapes
                                            without looking for anything in
                                            return.

                                            For there is a single harmony. Just
                                            as the world forms a single body
                                            comprising all bodies, so fate forms
                                            a single purpose, comprising all
                                            purposes.

                                            Not to feel exasperated, or
                                            defeated, or despondent because your
                                            days aren’t packed with wise and
                                            moral actions. But to get back up
                                            when you fail, to celebrate behaving
                                            like a human—however imperfectly—and
                                            fully embrace the pursuit that
                                            you’ve embarked on.

                                            The things you think about determine
                                            the quality of your mind. Your soul
                                            takes on the color of your thoughts.
                                            Color it with a run of thoughts like

                                            So other people hurt me? That’s
                                            their problem. Their character and
                                            actions are not mine. What is done
                                            to me is ordained by nature, what I
                                            do by my own.

                                            true good fortune is what you make
                                            for yourself. Good fortune: good
                                            character, good intentions, and good
                                            actions.

                                            How cruel—to forbid people to want
                                            what they think is good for them.
                                            And yet that’s just what you won’t
                                            let them do when you get angry at
                                            their misbehavior. They’re drawn
                                            toward what they think is good for
                                            them. —But it’s not good for them.
                                            Then show them that. Prove it to
                                            them. Instead of losing your temper

                                            Nature is pliable, obedient. And the
                                            logos that governs it has no reason
                                            to do evil. It knows no evil, does
                                            none, and causes harm to nothing. It
                                            dictates all beginnings and all
                                            endings.

                                            Perceptions like that—latching onto
                                            things and piercing through them, so
                                            we see what they really are. That’s
                                            what we need to do all the time—all
                                            through our lives when things lay
                                            claim to our trust—to lay them bare
                                            and see how pointless they are, to
                                            strip away the legend that encrusts
                                            them.

                                            And if you can’t stop prizing a lot
                                            of other things? Then you’ll never
                                            be free—free, independent,
                                            imperturbable. Because you’ll always
                                            be envious and jealous, afraid that
                                            people might come and take it all
                                            away from you. Plotting against
                                            those who have them—those things you
                                            prize. People who need those things
                                            are bound to be a mess—and bound to
                                            take out their frustrations on the
                                            gods. Whereas to respect your own
                                            mind—to prize it—will leave you
                                            satisfied with your own self, well
                                            integrated into your community and
                                            in tune with the gods as
                                            well—embracing what they allot you,
                                            and what they ordain.

                                            You take things you don’t control
                                            and define them as “good” or “bad.”
                                            And so of course when the “bad”
                                            things happen, or the “good” ones
                                            don’t, you blame the gods and feel
                                            hatred for the people responsible—or
                                            those you decide to make
                                            responsible. Much of our bad
                                            behavior stems from trying to apply
                                            those criteria. If we limited “good”
                                            and “bad” to our own actions, we’d
                                            have no call to challenge God, or to
                                            treat other people as enemies.

                                            Surrounded as we are by all of this,
                                            we need to practice acceptance.
                                            Without disdain. But remembering
                                            that our own worth is measured by
                                            what we devote our energy to.

                                            Is my intellect up to this? If so,
                                            then I’ll put it to work, like a
                                            tool provided by nature. And if it
                                            isn’t, then I’ll turn the job over
                                            to someone who can do better—unless
                                            I have no choice.

                                            To feel affection for people even
                                            when they make mistakes is uniquely
                                            human. You can do it, if you simply
                                            recognize: that they’re human too,
                                            that they act out of ignorance,
                                            against their will, and that you’ll
                                            both be dead before long. And, above
                                            all, that they haven’t really hurt
                                            you. They haven’t diminished your
                                            ability to choose.

                                            Each existing only briefly.

                                            Treat what you don’t have as
                                            nonexistent. Look at what you have,
                                            the things you value most, and think
                                            of how much you’d crave them if you
                                            didn’t have them. But be careful.
                                            Don’t feel such satisfaction that
                                            you start to overvalue them—that it
                                            would upset you to lose them.

                                            But, my good friend, consider the
                                            possibility that nobility and virtue
                                            are not synonymous with the loss or
                                            preservation of one’s life. Is it
                                            not possible that a real man should
                                            forget about living a certain number
                                            of years, and should not cling to
                                            life, but leave it up to the gods,
                                            accepting, as women say, that ‘no
                                            one can escape his fate,’ and turn
                                            his attention to how he can best
                                            live the life before him?”

                                            To watch the courses of the stars as
                                            if you revolved with them. To keep
                                            constantly in mind how the elements
                                            alter into one another. Thoughts
                                            like this wash off the mud of life

                                            forty years is as good as a
                                            thousand. Would you really see

                                            left and live it properly.

                                            Look at who they really are, the
                                            people whose approval you long for,
                                            and what their minds are really
                                            like. Then you won’t blame the ones
                                            who make mistakes they can’t help,
                                            and you won’t feel a need for their
                                            approval. You will have seen the
                                            sources of both—their judgments and
                                            their actions.

                                            And in most cases what Epicurus said
                                            should help: that pain is neither
                                            unbearable nor unending, as long as
                                            you keep in mind its limits and
                                            don’t magnify them in your
                                            imagination.

                                            Nature did not blend things so
                                            inextricably that you can’t draw
                                            your own boundaries—place your own
                                            well-being in your own hands. It’s
                                            quite possible to be a good man
                                            without anyone realizing it.
                                            Remember that.

                                            others, contempt for the senses, the
                                            interrogation of appearances,
                                            observation of nature and of events
                                            in nature.

                                            When you have trouble getting out of
                                            bed in the morning, remember that
                                            your defining characteristic—what
                                            defines a human being—is to work
                                            with others. Even animals know how
                                            to sleep. And it’s the
                                            characteristic activity that’s the
                                            more natural one—more innate and
                                            more satisfying.

                                            Remember: you shouldn’t be surprised
                                            that a fig tree produces figs, nor
                                            the world what it produces. A good
                                            doctor isn’t surprised when his
                                            patients have fevers, or a helmsman
                                            when the wind blows against him.

                                            There are brambles in the path? Then
                                            go around them. That’s all you need
                                            to know. Nothing more. Don’t demand
                                            to know “why such things exist.”
                                            Anyone who understands the world
                                            will laugh at you, just as a

                                            shocked at finding sawdust in his
                                            workshop, or a shoemaker at scraps
                                            of leather left over from work.

                                            to know any of this is to be

                                            will be the same annoying people
                                            they know now. And just as mortal.
                                            What does it matter to you if they

                                            the mind is invulnerable. It does

                                            its resistance is irrational. And if
                                            its judgment is deliberate and
                                            grounded in logic . . . ?

                                            independent of mine as their breath
                                            and bodies. We may exist for the
                                            sake of one another, but our will
                                            rules its own domain. Otherwise the
                                            harm they do would cause harm to me.
                                            Which is not what God intended—for
                                            my happiness to rest with someone
                                            else.
                                          </p>

                                            So this is how a thoughtful person
                                            should await death: not with
                                            indifference, not with impatience,
                                            not with disdain, but simply viewing
                                            it as one of the things that happen
                                            to us. Now you anticipate the
                                            child’s emergence from its mother’s
                                            womb; that’s how you should await
                                            the hour when your soul will emerge
                                            from its compartment.

                                            can escape humanity.

                                            And if not, remember: the capacity
                                            for patience was given us for a
                                            reason. The gods are patient with
                                            them too, and even help them to
                                            concrete things: health, money,
                                            fame. . . . Such is the gods’
                                            goodness.

                                            for yourself: . . . by comprehending
                                            the scale of the world . . . by

                                            thinking of the speed with which

                                            birth and death; the infinite time

                                            that follows.

                                            Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no,

                                            The logos gave you the means to see
                                            it—that a given person would act a
                                            given way—but you paid no attention.
                                            And now you’re astonished that he’s
                                            gone and done it. So when you call
                                            someone “untrustworthy” or
                                            “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on
                                            yourself. It was you who did wrong.
                                            By assuming that someone with those
                                            traits deserved your trust. Or by
                                            doing them a favor and expecting
                                            something in return, instead of
                                            looking to the action itself for
                                            your reward. What else did you
                                            expect from helping someone out?
                                            Isn’t it enough that you’ve done
                                            what your nature demands? You want a
                                            salary for it too? As if your eyes
                                            expected a reward for seeing, or
                                            your feet for walking. That’s what
                                            they were made for. By doing what
                                            they were designed to do, they’re
                                            performing their function. Whereas
                                            humans were made to help others. And
                                            when we do help others—or help them
                                            to do something—we’re doing what we
                                            were designed for. We perform our
                                            function.

                                            Whether it’s atoms or nature, the
                                            first thing to be said is this: I am
                                            a part of a world controlled by
                                            nature. Secondly: that I have a
                                            relationship with other, similar
                                            parts. And with that in mind I have
                                            no right, as a part, to complain
                                            about what is assigned me by the
                                            whole. Because what benefits the
                                            whole can’t harm the parts, and the
                                            whole does nothing that doesn’t
                                            benefit it. That’s a trait shared by
                                            all natures, but the nature of the
                                            world is defined by a second
                                            characteristic as well: no outside
                                            force can compel it to cause itself
                                            harm.

                                            the struggle. Both are deserters:
                                            the man who breaks and runs, and the
                                            one who lets himself be alienated

                                            not the reverse. In which case, that
                                            most highly developed and
                                            comprehensive nature—Nature
                                            itself—cannot fall short of artifice
                                            in its craftsmanship.

                                            To live a good life: We have the
                                            potential for it. If we can learn to
                                            be indifferent to what makes no
                                            difference. This is how we learn: by
                                            looking at each thing, both the
                                            parts and the whole. Keeping in mind
                                            that none of them can dictate how we
                                            perceive it. They don’t impose
                                            themselves on us. They hover before
                                            us, unmoving. It is we who generate
                                            the judgments—inscribing them on
                                            ourselves. And we don’t have to. We
                                            could leave the page blank—and if a
                                            mark slips through, erase it
                                            instantly.

                                            And why is it so hard when things go
                                            against you? If it’s imposed by
                                            nature, accept it gladly and stop
                                            fighting it. And if not, work out
                                            what your own nature requires, and
                                            aim at that, even if it brings you
                                            no glory.

                                            That kindness is invincible,
                                            provided it’s sincere—not ironic or
                                            an act. What can even the most
                                            vicious person do if you keep
                                            treating him with kindness and
                                            gently set him straight—if you get
                                            the chance—correcting him cheerfully
                                            at the exact moment that he’s trying
                                            to do you harm.

                                            That to expect bad people not to
                                            injure others is crazy. It’s to ask
                                            the impossible. And to let them
                                            behave like that to other people but
                                            expect them to exempt you is
                                            arrogant—the act of a tyrant.

                                            anger and fear and pain, is to

                                            attention to our impulses, making
                                            sure they don’t go unmoderated, that
                                            they benefit others, that they’re
                                            worthy of us. We need to steer clear
                                            of desire in any form and not try to
                                            avoid what’s beyond our control.

                                            Everything you’re trying to reach—by
                                            taking the long way round—you could
                                            have right now, this moment. If
                                            you’d only stop thwarting your own
                                            attempts. If you’d only let go of
                                            the past, entrust the future to
                                            Providence, and guide the present
                                            toward reverence and justice.
                                            Reverence: so you’ll accept what
                                            you’re allotted. Nature intended it
                                            for you, and you for it. Justice: so
                                            that you’ll speak the truth, frankly
                                            and without evasions, and act as you
                                            should—and as other people deserve.

                                            The left hand is useless at almost
                                            everything, for lack of practice.
                                            But it guides the reins better than
                                            the right. From practice.

                                            Pain. Pleasure. Death. Fame. Who is
                                            responsible for our own
                                            restlessness. That no one obstructs
                                            us. That it’s all in how you
                                            perceive it.

                                            you’re afraid of but never beginning
                                            to live properly . . . then you’ll
                                            be worthy of the world that made

                                            clothing, mansions, celebrity—the
                                            painted sets, the costume cupboard?

                                            If you can cut yourself—your
                                            mind—free of what other people do
                                            and say, of what you’ve said or
                                            done, of the things that you’re
                                            afraid will happen, the impositions
                                            of the body that contains you and
                                            the breath within, and what the
                                            whirling chaos sweeps in from
                                            outside, so that the mind is freed
                                            from fate, brought to clarity, and
                                            lives life on its own
                                            recognizance—doing what’s right,
                                            accepting what happens, and speaking
                                            the truth—

                                            If you can cut free of impressions
                                            that cling to the mind, free of the
                                            future and the past—can make
                                            yourself, as Empedocles says, “a
                                            sphere rejoicing in its perfect
                                            stillness,” and concentrate on
                                            living what can be lived (which
                                            means the present) . . . then you
                                            can spend the time you have left in
                                            tranquillity. And in kindness. And
                                            at peace with the spirit within you.

                                            It never ceases to amaze me: we all
                                            love ourselves more than other
                                            people, but care more about their
                                            opinion than our own. If a god
                                            appeared to us—or a wise human
                                            being, even—and prohibited us from
                                            concealing our thoughts or imagining
                                            anything without immediately
                                            shouting it out, we wouldn’t make it
                                            through a single day. That’s how
                                            much we value other people’s
                                            opinions—instead of our own.
